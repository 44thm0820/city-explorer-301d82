# Lab - Class 06 - Asynchronous code, and APIs

**Author**: Rey Mercado
**Version**: 1.0.0 (increment the patch/fix version number if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview

Today I will be building a React application that uses the Axios library to make user-initiated reqeusts for data from a thrid-party API.

Convert the `README.md` file to be documentation regarding your lab and its current state of development. Check the "documentation" section of the lab assignment for more details on how that should look AT MINIMUM.

<!-- Provide a high level overview of what this application is and why you are building it, beyond the fact that it's an assignment for this class. (i.e. What's your problem domain?) -->

## Getting Started

## Process

For every lab in this module, you will have a new partner. For this lab, you and your new partner(s) will spend the first 15 minutes planning out an approach to this lab’s work on a whiteboard.

## Draw the web request-response cycle for the current lab tasks (about 15 minutes).

Document the data flow: identify inputs and outputs for each part of the cycle.
Outline the functions that support this data flow.
Be sure to include these drawings in your README.md.
You will then work independently for the rest of the day, implementing your plan, coding in your own repository, submitting your own pull request.

## Change Log

Use this area to document the iterative changes made to your application as each feature is successfully implemented. Use time stamps. Here's an example:

01-01-2001 4:59pm - Application now has a fully-functional express server, with a GET route for the location resource.
